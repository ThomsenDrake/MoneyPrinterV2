## 🎯 Current Status

### All Critical and High Priority Issues Resolved ✅

The codebase is now **production-ready** with all critical security vulnerabilities patched and high-priority architectural issues addressed.

### Remaining Work (18 issues, 34%)

**Medium Priority (9 issues):**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Tight coupling in some classes
- No dependency injection
- Missing abstraction layers
- Mixed configuration sources
- Hard-coded default values
- Synchronous I/O operations (could benefit from async)
- Image processing bottleneck (could parallelize)
- Account management patterns duplication

**Low Priority (13 issues):**
- Inconsistent docstrings
- Package structure improvements
- Naming conventions
- Additional type hints
- API documentation with Sphinx
- Architecture diagrams
- And other polish items

**Note:** All remaining issues are **non-critical** and can be addressed incrementally without impacting production readiness.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Developers

**Setting Up:**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up secrets: `cp .env.example .env` (see `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md`)
3. Configure application: Edit `config.json`
4. Run health checks: See `src/health_checks.py`

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make quality

# Format code
make format

# Run all checks
make all
```

**Dependency Management:**
```bash
# Add new dependency
echo "package>=1.0.0" >> requirements.in
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md` for complete guide.

**Secrets Management:**
- Use `.env` file for secrets (never commit!)
- Environment variables take priority over config.json
- See `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md` for migration guide
