3. Configure application: Edit `config.json`
4. Run health checks: See `src/health_checks.py`

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make quality

# Format code
make format

# Run all checks

**Error Handling (Phase 7):**
```python
from exceptions import APIConnectionError, MoneyPrinterError
from error_handlers import retry_on_failure, safe_return

# Use specific exceptions
raise APIConnectionError("Failed to connect", endpoint="https://api.example.com")

# Retry unstable operations
@retry_on_failure(max_attempts=3, delay=2.0)
def fetch_data():
    return api_call()

# Safe operations that should never crash
@safe_return(default=None)
def get_optional_config(key):
    return config[key]
```
